# COMULIS Training School presentations

My slides for the [COMULIS Training School - Imaging Accross Scales](https://www.ana.unibe.ch/continuing_education/comulis_training_school/) 2025.

- [20250826_COMULIS_Welcome.tex](20250826_COMULIS_Welcome.tex) are the welcome slides with technicalities.
  The PDF is automatically compiled with a [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/latex.yaml) [^1] and hosted by GitHub Pages as [...Welcome.pdf](https://habi.github.io/Talk.2025.COMULIS/20250826_COMULIS_Welcome.pdf).
- [20250826_COMULIS_microCT.tex](20250826_COMULIS_microCT.tex) is the actual talk I'm giving, about microCT in general and some project relevant for the workshop.
  The PDF is compiled with the same [GitHub Action](.github/workflows/latex.yaml) and available at [...microCT.pdf](https://habi.github.io/Talk.2025.COMULIS/20250826_COMULIS_microCT.pdf)
